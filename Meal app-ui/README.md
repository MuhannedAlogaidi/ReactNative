        2.2.1 : Categories screen and I'll name the file categories screen to make it really clear what's inside there. This is the screen where we can select a category like Italian, German, American, so where we can select a food category.

        2.2.3 : favorites screen which is the screen that holds all our favorite recipes, our favorite meals.
        2.2.4 : MealDetailScreen, that's the screen we see if we tap on a single meal inside of a chosen category or on the favorite screen. This then shows us the ingredients and the detailed steps for this meal.
        2.2.5 : filters screen and this filters screen is the screen that allows us to set filters, like vegan food so that we only see recipes which are vegan or vegetarian or glutenFree or lactoseFree,
